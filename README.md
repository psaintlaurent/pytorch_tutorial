This is a repository for applying my machine learning and reinforcement learning knowledge to pyTorch.
I'm moving over to pyTorch since it appears to have a model that better matches the statistics, machine learning and
reinforcement learning literature.

I'm including matplotlib plots or tensoboard plots that are not on the tutorial website for *most* examples.

Once I'm done with the pytorch tutorials this will eventually include implementations of material from:

Reinforcement Learning by Richard S. Sutton & Andrew G. Barto
Machine Learning a Probabilistic Perspective by Kevin Murphy

For the time being, this will contain hobby projects and they are NOT a reflection of my employer or a reflection of my
professional work.
